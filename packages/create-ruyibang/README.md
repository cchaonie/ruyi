2. `node-lib`. If you want to create a node library, then use this one.
3. `react-spa`. If you want to create a SPA (Single Page Application) with React, then use this one.
4. [In Progress]`react-ssr`. If you want to create a web application with the support of SSR (Server Side Rendering), then use this one.
